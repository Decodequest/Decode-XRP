            <h1 className="pb-4">What is the XRP Ledger?</h1>
            <p>
              The XRP Ledger is a special digital network that helps people send
              money quickly all over the world without needing a middleman, like
              a bank. It uses technology called blockchain, which is like a
              digital ledger that safely records all transactions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="pb-8">
            <h1 className="pb-4">What makes XRP ledger special?</h1>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>
                Fast and Global: It can send money anywhere in the world in just
                a few seconds.
              </li>
              <li>
                No Central Control: Unlike banks, no single person or group
                controls the XRP Ledger. It's made by everyone who uses it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Safe: It keeps money transfers safe using complex math, so only
                the people involved can see or change their transactions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div className="pb-8">
            <h1 className="pb-4">How does it work?</h1>
            <p>
              The XRP Ledger uses a unique method called "federated consensus"
              to agree on transactions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>
                Validators: These are computers that check and agree on
                transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quick Decisions: They make a new record of all transactions
                every 4 to 6 seconds, which is super fast.
              </li>
              <li>
                Saves Energy: This method doesn't use a lot of electricity,
                making it better for the planet than some other systems.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div className="pb-8">
            <h1 className="pb-4">Keeping transactions safe</h1>
            <p>
              The XRP Ledger uses advanced security to make sure no one can
              tamper with transactions. Once a transaction is recorded, it
              cannot be changed, ensuring that your money is always safe.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="pb-8">
            <h1 className="pb-4">In short</h1>
            <p>
              The XRP Ledger is a modern way to transfer money that is fast,
              reliable, and eco-friendly. It uses cutting-edge technology to
              make sure transactions are secure and works without the need for
              central banks, making it a promising tool for the future of money
              transfers.
